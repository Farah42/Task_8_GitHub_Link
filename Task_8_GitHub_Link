The data consists of numerous CSV files, each corresponding
to orders from various months and years. 


I loaded these CSV files, cleanse and normalize the data,
and create the data marts. Finally, I provided the row counts and distinct
primary key counts for each data marts using powerBI. I started by loading all
the data into a single DataFrame and inspecting it. Then, I proceed with the
required tasks. (Load all data into a single DataFrame, Load and concatenate all
the CSV files, Cleanse and Normalize the Data, taking into consideration that
all data types are consistent, handle missing values, and duplicates data. I Created
three Data Marts and separated the data into different data marts based on the
business logic (Order, customer and product data mart). Then I calculated the
Row and Distinct Primary Key Counts for each data mart and saved the results in
a excel file.




Here are the steps to cleanse, normalize, and analyze the data
using Power BI:



Step 1: Load Data into Power BI

1. Opened Power BI Desktop.

2. Clicked on Get Data in the Home ribbon.

3. Selected Folder as the data source.

4. Navigate to the folder where my CSV files are stored and click OK.

5. Power BI displayed a list of files. Clicked Combine & Load.



Step 2: Cleanse and Normalize Data

In the Power Query Editor, I performed various data cleansing tasks:


1.Change Data Types


2.Remove Rows with Errors


Step 3: Create Data Marts

In the Power Query Editor, I created three data marts by using the Reference
query to add and remove unnecessary columns and filter rows as needed.

   

Step 4: Count Rows and Distinct Primary Keys

In the Data view of Power BI:

   - Select the table.

   - Go to the Modeling tab and create a new measure using formulas
to count rows and distinct primary:

     - CountRows = COUNTROWS(TableName)

     - CountDistinctPrimaryKey =
DISTINCTCOUNT(TableName[PrimaryKeyColumn])
